    <p class="surf-text">Surrounded by water and marine life, I developed a deep love for the ocean through swimming, diving, and water sports.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">My dad owned a watersports business, teaching people how to water ski behind his MasterCraft boat.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">That same environment sparked a lifelong passion for surfing — a sport that, at its core, is about patience, timing, and a sharp eye for detail.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">Learning to surf taught me to notice small changes in conditions — shifts in wind, movement in the water, or subtle imperfections in technique — things that may seem invisible to the untrained eye, but make all the difference in performance. That mindset naturally led me to QA.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">Like surfing, Quality Assurance is all about focus, precision, and spotting what others might miss. Today, I bring that same attention to detail to the digital world — catching bugs, refining systems, and making sure everything flows just right.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">My dream is to work remotely and experience true freedom — combining my passion for QA with a lifestyle that lets me explore some of the world’s most beautiful surf spots.</p>
    <p class="surf-text">To build a career where I can open my laptop a few meters from the waves, contribute meaningfully to a tech team, and ride out each day doing what I love — both on the screen and in the sea.</p>
