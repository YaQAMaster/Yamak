<h2 class="surf-title">Why QA?</h2>

<p class="surf-text">
Over the past two years, I’ve worked as a content writer and administrator for a small affiliate marketing business. Beyond creating content, I was also responsible for reviewing our websites before they went live — checking for errors, ensuring quality, and working closely with our programmer.

That hands-on experience sparked my interest in QA. I enjoyed the process of spotting issues, improving user experience, and making sure everything worked smoothly. Combined with my natural attention to detail and love for structured problem-solving, QA felt like the perfect next step.

Now, I’m pursuing this field with the goal of building a flexible, remote-friendly career where I can grow professionally while staying curious and detail-oriented.
